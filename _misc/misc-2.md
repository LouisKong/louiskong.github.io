<!-- 
This is an item in your portfolio. It can be have images or nice text. If you name the file .md, it will be parsed as markdown. If you name the file .html, it will be parsed as HTML.  -->
This is my second time to estabilish my personal homepage based on a popular homepage style called**Â Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme**. As the saying goes, never too old to learn. Hope it is a good start.
