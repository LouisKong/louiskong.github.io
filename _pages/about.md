I am a Research Associate from [the Institute of Intelligence Science and Engineering](https://iise.szpu.edu.cn/), [Shenzhen Polytechnic University (SZPU)](https://www.szpu.edu.cn/). My research interests include new electricity systems, electric vehicles, power-transportation coupled networks, and demand response issues. 

Before joining SZPU, I did my Ph.D. at the [State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City (SKL-IOTSC)](https://skliotsc.um.edu.mo/), [University of Macau (UM)](https://www.um.edu.mo/) under the supervision of [Prof. Hongcai Zhang](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/hczhang/) and [Prof. Ningyi Dai](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/nydai/). I received a BEng in Automation from [Shandong Univ.](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/), an MSc in ECE from [NUS](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), and an ME in [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/).
